# Prototype2 - Unity Game Project

This repository contains a **prototype Unity 2D game** developed as part of a personal experiment to test basic mechanics, interactions, and visual elements. The game is not a complete product but rather a foundation for testing various gameplay concepts, such as character control, interaction, combat, and UI management.

> ⚠️ **Note:** This is an early-stage prototype built for learning and experimentation. The codebase and gameplay are subject to change and may contain incomplete or placeholder elements.
